There are many methods for increasing productivity, but using timers or keeping a close eye on the time seems to be part of every effective workflow.

A "classic" method is Pomodoro: work for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes, and repeat until something like a meal break or the end of the work day.

A similar but more flexible method is Third Time:

> - **Work for as long or as short as you like**, until you want or need to break; then
> - **Break for up to one-third of the time** you’ve just worked.

The linked page explains the benefits of this system, and more detailed steps:

> 1. Note the time, or start a stopwatch
> 2. **Work** until you want or need to break
> 3. Divide how long you’ve just worked by 3 (or use your chosen fraction), and add any minutes left over from previous breaks
> 4. Set an alarm for that long
> 5. **Break** until the alarm goes off, or you decide to resume work
> 6. If you resume early, note how much time was left, to add to your next break
> 7. Go back to step 1.
> 
> Additional rules:
> 
> - If you have to stop work for a **non-work-related interruption**, start a break immediately.
> - You can (optionally) take a **big break** for lunch and/or dinner, lasting as long as you like. Set an alarm at the start for when you’ll resume work. A big break uses up any saved break minutes, so you can’t carry them over to the afternoon/evening.
> - **Avoid taking other unearned breaks** if possible — so try to do personal tasks during normal or big breaks, or before/after your work day.

I've also heard of workflows where you have a timer running 24/7, and starting a timer automatically stops the current one. Time tracking software like Toggl or Clockify helps to categorize the entries and see reports on progress. This workflow might be a bit extreme for most people, but it's easy to start doing something without a timer/alarm for when to stop when one would be helpful.

The most ideal system is probably to have a consistent daily schedule for everything, where all of your needs are met but you also get a lot of work done without the added complexity of the methods above. I believe everyone should strive for this, but it is usually unrealistic for most of life's tasks.
